    <h1>Solar Energy Optimization Through IoT Analytics</h1>
    <p>
      As solar becomes mainstream, efficiency is paramount. IoT analytics can unlock hidden potential in solar PV systems by offering real-time insights.
    </p>

    <h2>IoT for Smarter Solar</h2>
    <p>
      IoT devices monitor sunlight exposure, panel temperature, inverter efficiency, and environmental factors like dust or bird droppings.
      With this data, operators can optimize panel alignment, initiate cleaning, and predict output.
    </p>

    <h2>Benefits</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Improved ROI through higher uptime</li>
      <li>Detection of underperforming panels</li>
      <li>Forecasting generation against consumption trends</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      IoT analytics transforms solar energy into a smarter, more resilient systemâ€”fueling sustainability goals across industries and cities.
