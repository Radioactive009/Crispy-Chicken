    <p>We use essential cookies that are required to provide you with basic functions while using our Services. These functions include user session validation, for example. By continuing to use our Services, you accept the use of all essential cookies.</p>

    <p>Mobile identifiers for analytics can be accessed and used by apps on mobile devices in much the same way that websites access and use cookies. We use this data to understand the user behaviour & app interaction, crash logs etc. that help us improvise the product.</p>
    
    <h2>12. Retention of personal data</h2>
    <p>We retain personal data for as long as necessary to provide the services and fulfil the transactions you have requested, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, enforce our agreements, and other legitimate and lawful business purposes. Because these needs can vary for different data types in the context of different services, actual retention periods can vary significantly based on criteria such as user expectations or consent, the sensitivity of the data, the availability of automated controls that enable users to delete data, and our legal or contractual obligations. For example, we may retain your personal data for longer periods, where necessary, subject to applicable law, for security purposes.</p>
    <p>When we no longer have a legitimate need to process your information (e.g. after you delete your account), we will delete or anonymize your information from our active databases. We will also securely store the information and isolate it from further processing on backup discs until deletion is possible.</p>
    
    <h2>13. How we secure your information</h2>
    <p>We take reasonable measures necessary to protect your personal data from unauthorized access, alteration, or destruction; maintain data accuracy; and help ensure the appropriate use of your personal data. We have put in place contractual, technical and organizational measures to protect personal data against unauthorized access, use and disclosure. These measures have been carried out taking into account the state of the art, their implementation costs and the risks associated with the processing and nature of the personal data. When we disclose your personal information to third parties, including service providers, we require these companies to protect the personal information they receive.</p>
    <p>To help us protect personal data, we request that you use a strong password for your EddyBits’ or IoTix account and never share your password with anyone or use the same password with other sites or accounts.</p>
    <p>While we have tried to make our products and services safe and reliable, the confidentiality of any communication or material sent to or from us cannot be guaranteed. We, therefore, advise you to be careful when passing on personal data via the Internet. As with the disclosure of information on the Internet, please be aware that such information may be available to the public and, as a result, may be collected and used by others without your consent. You also acknowledge that your use of the Internet and all other means of communication with us is solely at your own risk.</p>
    
    <h2>14. Cross-border data transfers</h2>
    <p>To facilitate our global operations, and in accordance with applicable laws, we may store and process your personal data in your country, in India, or in any other country where we or our affiliates, subsidiaries, or service providers operate their facilities (including the USA). This may be to a country other than the one in which the data was provided or collected. When we transfer your personal data, we do so in compliance with applicable data protection laws. We take steps to protect personal data in whatever country it is stored in, transferred, processed to or accessed from.</p>
